# Otto Throttle
A basic auto-throttle for X-Plane 11/12, written with love in C++ and Lua <3

Tired of manually adjusting your throttle in cruise, when all you want to do is make a cup of coffee? 
Afraid something might go wrong while you´re gone? 
Don´t worry! Otto is here to take care of you.

Otto-throttle is a basic auto-throttle script that adjusts your thrust based on your selected speed.

Intended to be used in cruise with the FlyJSim 732 & 722, but it should be useable with other aircraft aswell.
